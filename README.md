## Install
First step is to install webpack and friends
`npm install -g webpack`
`npm install vue-loader --save-dev`
`npm install vue`
`npm install vue-router`
Additionally, you can install stylus-loader as well since I use stylus for styling
`npm install stylus-loader --save-dev`
`npm install style-loader --save-dev`
`npm install nib` // prefixing your CSS rules

## Run
Yup, the config is ready, all you have to do is jut hit `webpack` on your project root directory
